# The code you will be writing here will be production grade...
# First write and test the AI logic in local_ai.py as a clean, pure function.
# Do not handle any request/response or request.data here.
# Do not use file paths or local files to get data inside the function.
# Only accept input data as function arguments (json/dict/list etc.).
# This will be called in a function inside views.py (FBV/CBV) with passing data as function arguments,
# Always ensure your function is reusable, testable, and side-effect free.
# use success and error message.
# from data_format import test_cases
#
# for case in test_cases:
#     func_name = case['function']
#     args = case['input']
#     # call function dynamically or via if-else and pass args
#
