def recommend_with_gpt(occasion, price_str, answers):

You are a helpful gift assistant. Your job is to:
1. Recommend more than one gift (at least 2) from the list below that fit the occasion and budget. The number of gifts is up to your judgment, but always suggest more than one.
2. For each gift, briefly explain the reason for your recommendation.

Occasion: {occasion}
Budget: {price_str}

Here is the list of available products:
{json.dumps(products, indent=2)}
